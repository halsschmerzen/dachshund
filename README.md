# üì¶ dachshund - A Kleinanzeigen Scraper

This Python project is a web scraper designed to monitor listings on [Kleinanzeigen.de](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/) for specific items and notify you when a new listing appears below your set price cap. It uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and parse the listings and is capable of excluding listings based on predefined keywords.

## üöÄ Features

- **Customizable Search**: You can specify the product you're looking for, set a maximum price cap, and define an update interval.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Continuously checks for new listings and alerts you when new items are available.
- **Keyword Filtering**: Filters out listings based on excluded keywords (e.g., "Suche" for users who are looking for something rather than selling).
- **Formatted Output**: Provides color-coded output in the terminal using `colorama` for easy reading.
- **External Keyword Configuration**: Supports reading banned keywords from an external file (`banned_keywords.txt`), allowing easier customization of filtered terms without modifying the code.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kleinanzeigen-scraper.git
cd kleinanzeigen-scraper
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows
.\env\Scripts\activate

# On MacOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure the `requirements.txt` contains:

```txt
requests
beautifulsoup4
colorama
```

### 4. Run the Script

```bash
python scraper.py
```

## üîß Usage

When you run the script, it will prompt you for three inputs:

1. **Product name**: Enter the name of the product you're searching for.
2. **Maximum price**: Set the price cap (in EUR) for listings you'd like to monitor.
3. **Update interval**: Specify the time interval (in seconds) for checking new listings.

For example:
```
Please enter the product you want to look out for: Nintendo Switch
Please enter the maximum price-cap you want to see: 200
Please enter the interval in which you want to update your requests: 60
```

The scraper will then continuously check Kleinanzeigen for new listings matching your criteria. When a new listing is found, it will display information like the title, price, and a link to the item.

### Example Output:

```bash
Checking for new listings...
New Listing Found! Title: Nintendo Switch, Link: https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/Nintendo-Switch/12345, Price: 180‚Ç¨
Waiting for before next check...
```

## üìù Configuration

### Banned Keywords

#### 1. External File Configuration

Instead of hardcoding banned keywords, you can now place your keywords in a `banned_keywords.txt` file for easier maintenance and customization. Create a `resources/` folder, place the `banned_keywords.txt` file in it, and add your keywords to the file.

Example `banned_keywords.txt`:

```txt
# Keywords to filter out
Suche
SUCHE
!SUCHE!
DS,2DS,3DS XL
```

The script will automatically load the keywords from this file. Comments (lines starting with `#`) and empty lines will be ignored.

To configure the script to read from this file, ensure the following folder structure:

```
your_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ scraper.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ banned_keywords.txt
```

The `scraper.py` file automatically reads the banned keywords from `resources/banned_keywords.txt` when it runs. You no longer need to modify the code to change the keywords.

#### 2. Default Hardcoded Keywords

You can still use the hardcoded `banned_title_keywords` array in the script if you'd prefer not to use an external file. Here's how it looks in the code:

```python
banned_title_keywords = ["Suche", 'suche', 'SUCHE', '!SUCHE!', 'DS,2DS,3DS XL']
```

This ensures that unwanted listings like search requests or unrelated products are filtered out.
